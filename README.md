This is a TypeScript program for a simple drawing 
application in a HTML5 compatible web browser.  It 
is programmed on an Android tablet using the Xed-editor.
Termux is used as the shell and environment for running
the tsc transpiler and git and gh tools for source code
control.  The Simple HTTP Server is used to host it
on the tablet.
